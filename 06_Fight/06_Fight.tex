\section{Fight Against The Machines}

Fake accounts, bots, face swaps. All these seem to be the beginning of a dystopian reality where common users like you and me can be outnumbered by a bunch of zeros and ones on someone's screen.

Who can you trust? Are your Facebook friends sharing true stories? Did that President really say something like that? Did your friend really meet Mark Zuckerberg?

What if someone creates tens of thousands of realistic profiles, and creates an alternate version of historic reality? Is this happening already?

Some of what I have mentioned already is. And the fight has already begun.

As I have already mentioned, social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are already putting in practice countermeasures to prevent the use of fake accounts and fake news, like analyzing graph structures \cite{Identify5:online} or the relationship between different types of interactions amongst users \cite{Fullarti91:online}.

Even Josie O' Campbell and her generated friends can have a hard time as of today if you look carefully at her picture. Notice the shirt, the background, and how unnatural the wrinkles on her face look up close. Sure, it does fool you when she occupies the space of 128 square pixels, but for now it is still very, very hard to generate something of quality out of her.

In the meantime though, we can do some fun things, like making Josie dance for us at the sound of a famous Polish song: \url{https://youtu.be/FSgHh5hwwWc}

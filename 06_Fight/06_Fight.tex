Fake accounts, bots, face swaps. All these seem to be the beginning of a dystopian reality where common users like you and me can be outnumbered by a bunch of zeros and ones on someone's screen.

Who can you trust? Are your Facebook friends sharing true stories? Did that President really say something like that? Did your friend really meet Mark Zuckerberg?

What if someone creates tens of thousands of realistic profiles, and creates an alternate version of historic reality? Is this happening already?

Unfortunately, we don't know yet. It is fair to say that with the current technology, anyone is able with enough time and/or money to create the things that I have described above. Heck, they exist already.
